# Spotify Playlist Generator

Automatic spotify playlist generator (psuedo Spotify Song Radio) written in Rust leveraging GitHub Actions.

## Motivation

This project was done as an exercise of using Rust's reqwest crate to query APIs and also an exercise using GitHub actions as a CI tool. This project was written entirely in Rust to explore the speed difference between a pure Rust implementation and a pure Python implementation when working in a CI environment.
